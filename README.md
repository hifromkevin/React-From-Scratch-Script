# React-From-Scratch-Script
A script that automagically creates a bare-bones React application from scratch, including FontAwesome, SASS, and Webpack. Props to @camnix for the idea!

## Steps
1. Copy script.txt into your project folder
2. Navigate to your project folder using terminal
3. Type 'sh script.txt' into terminal
4. Fill out the information for your package.json file
5. Success!

## Next Steps
1. Add your "start" script to package.json:   "start": "node server/index.js" (or "nodemon server/index.js" if nodemon is installed on your machine)
2. Add your "build" script to package.json:   "build": "webpack --watch"
3. Navigate to your project folder (if you are not already inside). Type "npm start" into terminal
4. In a new terminal window, type "npm run build"
5. On your web browser, type "localhost:3005"
6. Have fun!
